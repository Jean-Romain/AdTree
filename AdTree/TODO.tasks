- Suggest downsampling point clouds for better efficiency (in the readme).
- Show the smooth skeleton
- Allow users to output the smooth skeleton
- Move TreeViewer::reconstruct_skeleton() and TreeViewer::add_leaves() to class Skeleton, both returning a SurfaceMesh.
- Save the smoothed branches (with name smoothed_skeleton_) as a graph, like simplified_skeleton_;
- Merge smooth_branches() and extract_branch_surface() with parameter
  	enum BranchType {
		BT_SIMPLIFIED,
		ST_SMOOTHED
	};
